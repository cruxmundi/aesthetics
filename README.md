# Aesthetics Relational Analysis Repository

This research repository serves as a centralized knowledge base for visually exploring how different aesthetics influence one another across disciplines, cultures, and time periods.

The repository contains code and data related to the CRUX MUNDI aesthetics relational analysis project. The project focuses on exploring the relationships between various aesthetic concepts, theories, and trends. By conducting a relational analysis, we aim to gain insights into the underlying patterns within aesthetics.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: This directory contains the datasets used for the analysis.
- `code/`: This directory contains the code for conducting the aesthetic relational analysis.
- `results/`: This directory stores the results and findings of the analysis.
- `docs/`: This directory contains additional documentation, including research papers, reports, and presentation slides.

## Getting Started

Cloning a repository is a fundamental operation in version control systems like Git, crucial for collaborative development. The process involves several steps, typically initiated from a command-line interface. First, one opens the Terminal on Linux, Mac, or Windows navigating to the desired directory for the clone. Using the git clone command followed by the repository's URL, the user requests a copy of the repository from the remote server to their local machine. If authentication is required, the user provides their credentials or access token. Git then begins cloning the repository, transferring all files and commit history. The duration of this process depends on the repository's size and the internet connection speed. Once completed, the user can navigate to the cloned repository directory and verify its contents using the ls command. This process enables developers to access, modify, and contribute to the codebase, facilitating collaboration and version control in software development projects.

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone [https://github.com/cruxmundi/aesthetics.git]`
2. Navigate to the cloned directory: `cd aesthetics-relational-analysis`
3. Install any necessary dependencies.
4. Run the code or scripts provided in the `code/` directory.
5. View the results in the `results/` directory.
